# DAV Hut Crawler

The idea of this script is to scrape the data from the [online reservation portal](https://www.alpenverein.de/huetten-wege-touren/huetteninfo/huetten-in-den-alpen/onlinereservierungssystem-der-alpenvereinshuetten_aid_28962.html). This allows to check availability for any date in the current season. 



## Installation


## Usage

- Select start-date (the next 14 days are evaluated)
- Select all huts or a list of huts ```[1,2,30]``` the IDs can be found in ...

- For booking, the huts can be found with their ID at ```https://www.alpsonline.org/reservation/calendar?hut_id=1```


## Further Ideas

- Putting everything in a google colab, so everyone can run it from everywhere
